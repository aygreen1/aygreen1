  <li><strong>I was born in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to the United States as a child. I  am an American Citizen and went to grade school in Des Moines, WA,<br>
    <br>
and Dallas,  TX. After high school, I moved back to Washington state from Texas. I started  pursuing a job as a CNC machinist for a company named Exact Aerospace, where<br>
<br>
I  found an interest in programming and machinery. After three years, I joined the  Army for six years and worked splitting the time between special forces and an  airborne <br>
<br>
infantry unit. After my military contract ended, I enrolled in Wake  Tech community college and bought a house in Clayton, NC.&nbsp;</strong>  <br>
